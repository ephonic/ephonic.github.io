Prof. Fan Yang received his B.E. Degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2003, and his Ph.D degree from Fudan University in 2008. He joined Fudan University as an assistant Professor in 2008. He is now a professor in the School of Microelectronics/State Key Lab of Integrated Circuits and Systems at Fudan University.

His research is mainly focused on design automation of integrated circuits, including modeling, simulation and optimization of analog circuits, high-level synthesis, logic simulation, physical design, and DFM of digital integrated circuits, design of AI accelerators, compiler techniques for AI accelerators, machine learning techniques and their applications in EDA.

He won First-class prize of Natural Science Shanghai in 2012, Best Paper award of Integration, the VLSI Journal 2018, First Place of ICCAD contest 2022 Problem C. He also got several best paper nominations such as DAC 2014, DAC 2017 and ASPDAC 2017. He was supported by National Science Foundation for Excellent Young Scholars in 2018.
